# Movie Picture

This is the Movie Picture project part of the Udacity Cloud DevOps Engineer Course
The base of this project is provided by Udacity.
On top of that, my code enriches it, in order to meet the project exam.

## Notes:
- You need a github repo
- You need to create a folder .github
- In .github you need to create another folder --> workflows
- In the end you should have /repo/.github/workflows/yourworkflow.yml
